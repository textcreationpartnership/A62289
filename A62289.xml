            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Psalm. 34.19.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Great (or many) are the Troubles of the Righteous, but the Lord will deliver him out of all.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN the World was in its Cradle and Religion in her Swadling Clouts, The Wisdom of Heaven thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to educate the tender years of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Piety with the alluring hopes of a temporal Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to prompt and encourage men to a ready entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Services: For had Religion in her tender years appear'd with an austere look and morose behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, she must of necessity have had fewer admirers of her Beauty. Least therefore she should meet but with a slender respect and mean entertainment, she came into the World with a mild aspect and for her dowry had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36814:3"/> all the advantages of a temporal felicity, entituled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her followers, which was the state of her first mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation, or making her self known to the World.</p>
            <p>But when she was grown somewhat elder and of a more strong constitution, God desisted from courting men by the hopes of her portion of splendid prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and goodly heritages, that they might be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of her Beauty and not of the Appendants, that he might see whether it was out of pure and undefiled love to Religion, or out of affection to the World, which made them to comply with the observance of his Laws, upon which account he did then command them to renounce the World and all their hopes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that they should no longer live by sense, but Faith; that they must expect to be encountred with sorrows and afflictions, calamities and crosses, if they would be reputed his children, and lead a vertuous and godly life.</p>
            <p>And this is that condition of the Righteous Holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> describeth in the text, where looking on the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they suffer, he seemeth to cry, <hi>Great are the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Righteous;</hi> respecting the Promise he seemeth to sing <hi>the Lord will deliver them out of all:</hi> Both which make our lives fitly compar'd to a Musick-book, where we shall seldom observe many white notes, but they art intermixed with black, and both together compose the sweetest harmony.</p>
            <p>God set's us our lesson in a little book; it contains no more then two pages, one stiled consolation the other dissolution, 'tis necessary for both to take their turns; In the day of prosperity, remember thy self of adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, In the day of adversity comfort thy self with the hopes of prosperity: For the divine providence min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles our life as one would Wine and Water in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36814:3"/> same Cup, Some drink the purest, others the most compound but all taste a commixtion, <hi>for great are the troubles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Psalm</hi> the sweet Singer of <hi>Israel</hi> compos'd after he had chang'd his Behaviour and feigned himself mad in the Court of <hi>Abimelech</hi> his deadly enemy, which dissimulation proved a means for happy deliverance from that imminent peril which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had most infallibly proved fatal.</p>
            <p>He therefore no sooner saw the net broken, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self escaped as a Bird from the hand of the Fowler, but he tunes his instrument and falls a warbling forth the praises of the Almighty, saying,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>verse</hi> 1.</note>
               <hi>I will always praise the Lord,</hi> which may serve as a reproach to them who day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe the benigne providence of God in protecting them from those perils and dangers, which are obvious to all amidst the changes and chances of this mortal life, yet seldom or never send up their praises to him, from whence cometh their help; Nay, they will scarce be brought to acknowledge 'tis the hand of the Lord which hath brought such mighty things to pass.</p>
            <p>But Holy <hi>David</hi> here thinks it too mean a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance for none but himself to sing the marvelous kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Lord, he therefore entreats others to bear a part with him in this consort of thanksgiving, saying, <hi>Oh magnifie the Lord with me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 3.</note>
               <hi>and let us exalt his Name to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! Men think they exceed in their duty, if when Heav'n hath been concerned in procuring a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, they cry out with the Pharisee, <hi>Lord I thank thee;</hi> and conceit it too troublesome and tedious a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be always telling forth his loving kindess unto others.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36814:4"/>
            <p>Our <hi>Psalmist</hi> therefore to prompt and encourage them to this holy duty and to incite them to piety, reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons up a Catalogue of the many privileges of the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous. How that their crys will pierce beyond the Clouds, and sound in the ears of God, for they are open to their complaint, how that he is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite spirit.</p>
            <p>Yea, let never so many sorrows and afflictions op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Righteous, yet still in his appointed time and pleasure he will not only deliver them from the lightest and least burthensome, but also from the most torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diresom, yea, from all and every one of them, For though <hi>great are the troubles of the Righteous, yet the Lord will deliver him out of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which words present us with these Two Considerations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, The condition of the Righteous man upon earth, or the Religious person presented to us in Sables, with ashes sprinkled on his head, his garments rent, his heart broken, himself a companion, a man and friend of sorrows, <hi>Great are the Troubles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have a confident assurance of this mans delivery from this his forlorn estate, <hi>The Lord will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him out of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We begin with the State of the Righteous upon earth,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 14.1.</note>
               <hi>Man that is born of a Woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery,</hi> saith that picture of patience and Landschape of misery, Holy <hi>Job,</hi> who took the heigth of other mens miseries by surveying his own afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for though he was an upright man, one who had an awful reverence for the majestie of Heaven, and that combining with his love, caused him to shun all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36814:4"/> occasions and appearances of evil; yet still as he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to avoid all the tempting evils of sin, the evil of afflictions pursued him close at his heels, for he was filled to the brim with the very Gall and Bitterness of Sorrows.</p>
            <p>How was he sequestred from all the Blessings of this Life? plunder'd of his Earthly Goods! robb'd of his Children, the little models of himself! and from the hands of an ill-advising Wife, delivered into the hands of Satan, to be buffeted and scourged at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Few and evil have been the days of my life,</hi> saith the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Jacob,</hi> one of the chief Darlings of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.9.</note> yet what a large draught did he drink of the Cup of salt Tears of afflictions! How was he banished from the knees of his aged Father! from the bosom of his loving and tender-hearted Mother! What an inveterate enemy to him was his Brother <hi>Esau?</hi> who forced him to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel into a strange Country, only accompanied with his Staff and his Scrip, almost clad with no other Garments than the sable-weeds of wo; having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bed than the cold Earth to rest his wearied and tender Limbs; no other Canopy than that of Heaven; no other Pillow than a Marble-stone, which, like a kind-hearted Host, did, by its weeping, seem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserate the hard misfortune of this unhappy Pilgrim; who, after all this, was constrain'd for meer mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to serve a <hi>Pagan</hi> in a strange Land, for many years.</p>
            <p>Yes, and as we have seen the afflictions of this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man in his own person, so we may track the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of them in that of his Off-spring, for they were the Coheirs, not only of his substance, but also of his sorrows. But to discourse of all their troubles, crosses, and tribulations, would make your ears undergo an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:36814:5"/> Tyranny, whilst we passed through this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of wo. This then shall suffice, that they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the Red-Sea of affliction, before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Promised Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>verse</hi> 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless these People were Gods own chosen Inheritance, or, to use the Prophets expression, the Friends of God, and greater favourites in the Court of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.</note>Notwithstanding which, the Wisdom of Heaven thought it convenient to purifie them in the Furnace of Afflictions, the more gloriously to adorn them with those Spiritual Ornaments, which can render them most amiable in the Eyes of the great King.</p>
            <p>But amongst all, who have suffered affliction, who ever met with more hardships than <hi>David;</hi> For he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Type of Christ, was always hedged about with the Cross; as Christ was contemned of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, so <hi>David</hi> of his Brethren: As Christ fled into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> so <hi>David</hi> unto <hi>Gath:</hi> As Christ received Food of Women, so <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Abigail:</hi> As <hi>Herod</hi> persecuted Christ, so <hi>Saul</hi> persecuted <hi>David:</hi> Yes, and the wrath of the King created a number of Enemies, insomuch that though he was annointed, he could not reign; and when he reigned, his reign was but a Warfare: The <hi>Philistines</hi> against him, the <hi>Amorites</hi> against him, the <hi>Edomites</hi> against him, yea and <hi>Absalom</hi> too, for whom he would have died, rose up against him. His Son, who was his darling, prov'd Traitor unto him; and Viper-like, sought to deprive hin of life, who gave him breath: Is it strange then that <hi>David</hi> affirms? <hi>Great are the troubles, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps some may confess, 'Tis true, whilst Religion was clouded, and the Law had shadowed the brightness thereof, men were overspread with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities

            <p>To which I answer.</p>
            <p>If we take a prospect of the troubles of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous under the Law, we shall conclude it was but a little Cloud which arose like the Palm of a mans hand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to those Storms and Tempests, which have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and spread themselves over the face of the whole earth, under the dispensation of the Gospel, for in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral blessings and earthly felicities, the Law hath the preeminence.</p>
            <p>For in the time of the Law, God promised to <hi>Moses,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For if we reflect on them with an impartial eye, we shall conclude them highly conducive to the good and benefit of Gods Children.</p>
            <p>For do I own the right and Sovereignty of God over me? if so, I must consequently submit to his hand, kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Rod that scourgeth me, and then my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be more medicinal then afflictive.</p>

            <p>Nay, let us but consult Nature we may make the same remarques, where we shall behold the Sun dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth more brisk and lively Rays after an Eclypse, The Sea more calm after it hath been discompos'd and ruffl'd by a Tempest,; and the Air much fairer when it hath wept those showrs which did obscure its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, upon which account <hi>Seneca</hi> did affirm that <hi>as Storms and Tempests did contribute to the clearness of the Heavens and smoothness of the Sea, even so the enterchanges of prosperity and adversity did much contribute to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How could we judge of that pleasure the Spring and Summer entertain us with, if they were not ushered in by the piercing winds and cold of the two contrary Seasons. Neither can happiness delight us, till we first bear the affronts of infelicity.</p>
            <p>For was it it the power of humane nature to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe an antidote as a preservative from all manner of miseries, that very want of miseries would prove an occasion of misery, because the mind cloyed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual happiness would prove a glut and burthen to it self, disgusting that at last, which an intermission would have rendred pleasant.</p>
            <p>Doth not that meat which is most pleasing to our pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, by our dayly feasting thereon, both take away our appetite and proves loathsome and not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
            <p>Even so it is with the pleasures of this world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36814:7"/> more unpleasant than when they are not served up with the sowr herbs of adversity.</p>
            <p>But perhaps some may here object, that if we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver relish happiness without a mixture of evil, we might thence infer, the Angels were not sufficiently happy, because they attained their perfection of bliss without passing through tribulation; for like the Lillies of the field they neither spinn'd nor toyl'd to be cloathed with the robe of glory.</p>
            <p>I answer, There is a great difference between the condition of things eternal and things temporal, Angels entred almost as soon into felicity as being, They being placed in the upper Region of the the World, where miseries cannot approach, and being so singularly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by God, needed not to be ballanced by the counterpoize of adversities, but as for us we are born in a soil as fertile in calamities as Forrests with Birds, and Rivers with Fish, and are likewise extreamly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Gods grace, when we long enjoy prosperity We grow wanton and are ready to kick against our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, so long as we are puffed up with prosperity, till the Scene is changed and we come to act a more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly part, and then adversity opens our eyes that we may perceive those noble felicities which attend and wait upon her, and also maketh us to understand who is the Author and Original from whence they proceed. And this is the reason why Angels are perfectly happy, without afflictions, but men must first be afflicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be happy, made miserable before they can be glorious, because they are not capacitated for the infusions of grace, until they have freed and ridd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of all earthly matters whatsoever.</p>
            <p>We must never look to ascend Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> till we first have climbed Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> nor can we eat of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36814:7"/> Honey-comb he fed on after his Resurrection, until we have pledged him in that Vinegar and Gall he drank upon the Cross.</p>
            <p>God will have it so for several reasons, whereof these are the principal.</p>
            <p>The first reason why God visits us with afflictions may be to Withdraw us from the love of this World.</p>
            <p>For whilst we are swallowed up with the pleasing conceit of the flourishing condition of our goodly Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and prosperous fortunes, our devotion proves a melancholy disturber, and one that exacts too severe a service from the minds of generous Spirits, God is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined as one who deals after too rough and rugged a manner because he will not licence us to be always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in our jollities, but expecteth some certain parts not only of our lives, but also of every day to be set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for his service and worship, and this makes Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to meet but with a slight entertainment at our hands, this makes us stopp our ears at the voice of the Charmer, our hearts are wholly ravish'd with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful reflexions on our great abundance till we prove totally forgetful both of our eternal interest and also of the respect due to him who hath blessed us with the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Land.</p>
            <p>They are the cloddy incumbrances of the World, that debase and clogg our spirits making them listless and unactive, which like Bird-lime hamper and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle our souls, indisposing our minds for the most noble and clarified contemplations of eternity. But when the pruning-hook of afflictions comes to lop off these corrupting branches, then are we brought to hate that which before was the delight of our eyes, and sole posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of our hearts, and to hunger and thirst after that which formerly seemed crude and nauseous to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. Ill</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:36814:8"/>
            <p>weeds are to be destroyed before we can sow good Corn,; neither is the Soul capacitated for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of divine truths until some sinister accident accident and cross affliction hath cleansed and purged it from the dross of the World.</p>
            <q>Aurem cordis Tribulatio aperit, quam saepe prosperitas hujus mundi claudit.</q>
            <p>Tribulation opens the ear of the heart, which is too frequently shut and deafned by worldly prosperity.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Antiochus</hi> when he enjoyed the constant Series of a smiling fortune, boasted himself superior to God himself, but when the inconstant Goddess withdrew her beams, and appeared unto him under a Cloud of troubles, He changed his note, for having received a fall out of his Chariot, and his Insolency curbed by an immediate blow from Heaven, He could say,
<q>Justum est hominem mortalem subditum esse Deo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is meet and requisite for Mortal Men, to be Subject to the Immortal God.</p>
            <p>So likewise <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>buchadnezzar</hi> in his carier of impiety, defied the Lord of Hosts, and proudly vaunted himself against the Almighty, until he enter'd into the Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his wrath, and Metamorphosed this proud King into a base beast, and then he could confess <hi>the Lord was able to abase all them that walk in pride.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. <hi>4.</hi> last v.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For when God perceives a constant course of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness cannot wean us from our sins, he then applyes the Ministers of his Fury, the storms and tempests of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36814:8"/> to ruffle us out of them. 'Tis true great pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities do not easily corrupt the souls which have taken a good temper in the fear of God, nevertheless they wound and in some sort change them.</p>
            <p>A little Bee sometimes playeth so long upon her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that by much walking there she entangleth her wings; So a Soul yea one of those most eminent for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and piety, being continually soothed with a long sequel of the good successes of the affairs of the World, taketh some small flight out of it self, seeking recreation in a smiling and delicate air, which affords nothing but objects of pleasure and delight; But so soon as adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath given her blow, it reentreth into it self, it fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self within it self, it fasteth it self, it knoweth it self, it findeth God in the bottom of her heart, afflicted and perplext with the revolutions of the World, she raises and darts her self above the ways of the Moon, and Tracks of the Sun, to that goodly Temple of Eternity, where Spirits dwell disrobed of these garments of flesh and bones, which we dragg along with us in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life. This is that High-Rode the devout soul jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys in so soon as she is alienated from the Court of prosperity, and disentangled from the affairs of the World; She then enters into a sweet retirement, and looks on the embroideries of nature in the Mountains and Vallies, Forrests and Rivers, as a Theater declaring the glory of God, and shewing his <hi>Handy-work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She relisheth this retreat from the World as <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven and tasts the deep silence of sorrow with incredible delight. Oh! how will she be delighted! How will she be ravished! when she shall reflect on the marvelous kindness of God towards her, that he should chasten her here, least she should be chastised for ever, that she should be afflicted with sorrows in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36814:9"/> this life, to free her from eternal gnashings of teeth, that he should deprive her of the gilded nothings of this World, that she may enjoy an everlasting and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream good; That he should make her unfortunate here, least she should be eternally unhappy amidst the tortures of Brimstone and Fire hereafter; In a word, How happy will she be, when she shall consider how God hath made her smart under the light afflictions of an adverse fortune on earth, to adopt her for an eternal and exceeding weight of glory in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Her adversity will make her imagine, as if she were discoursing with God face to face; This gall will make her open her eyes and see that it is the hand of God which presseth her sore, and the consideration that it is the Lord, will make her to say cheerfully with old <hi>Eli,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18.</note>
               <hi>Let him do what seemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed until we be thus varnish'd and brightned; till we be refined by this fire of affliction, until we have whitened our souls by the tears of sorrow, our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will espouse the quarrel of the World, and wholly declare in favour of it.</p>
            <p>God therefore to curb us that we may not stray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our limits, keeps us in a vale of tears often leading us through an <hi>Aceldema,</hi> a field of bloud and persecution, that with <hi>Jacob</hi> we may long for our Fathers house, not saying with St. <hi>Peter, it is good for us to be here,</hi> but rather with St. <hi>Paul, I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if, like the Moon in the Eclypse, we fail not to appear dark on that side which looketh towards earth, we shall most assuredly appear radiant and bright on that which tends towards Heaven, for it is to withdraw our affections from of the World that, <hi>Great are the troubles of the Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:36814:9"/>
            <p>A Second Reason why God visits us with afflictions may be to draw us to amendment of life.</p>
            <p>Thus the Royal Prophet, <hi>Before I was troubled I went wrong, but now have I known thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the eyes of <hi>Tobit</hi> were opened by the gall of the Fish, so the judgments of Heaven inflicted on us make us to reflect on the past actions of our life, that we may correct and reform all the errataes and misdeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anors thereof.</p>
            <p>For as the Rod of <hi>Moses</hi> stricken on the Stony Rock, caused whole Buckets of water to issue out thence, in like manner the Rod of afflictions smiting on our flinty and obdurate hearts, forceth whole Rivers of tears to flow from our eyes for our sins committed.</p>
            <p>For what is more natural to every one, when he is in distress, than to call to remembrance those sins, which he concludes the occasion thereof?</p>
            <p>When Heaven is pouring forth its vials of wrath and vengeance upon us, can we act so insensibly, as well as irrationally, as not to commune with our hearts, and ask our souls what have we done? How have I deserved this? what notorious crime have I commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I have made my God who delighteth not in the misery of his people, so highly displeased with me, as to afflict my body with this disease, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper?</p>
            <p>Is it not for the Plague of the heart that I am now tormented with the Plague in my Body? was not I afflicted with this tumour, because I was so affected with the tympany of pride? How come I dismembred in my Limbs, but because I did not set the broken bones of my soul together? Had I been afflicted with Strangury or Stone, had I dissolved the Stone in my heart by the tears of a really godly sorrow? I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36814:10"/> been oppressed with this Calenture, had not that more fatal one of anger needed a cure; was not this Feaver, this Sickness or that Disease prescribed by God as medicinal for this or that Sin? And when he hath ransacked his soul to the botom and found out the troubler of <hi>Israel,</hi> the <hi>Jonah</hi> who raiseth these Storms and Tempests, the Rebel who disquiets him in his peace, what can be the issue of it, but that he bring him forth and stone him to death; I mean that he should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly sorry for his sin, and make an absolute reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, least if he return to his wickedness, a worse thing fall unto him.</p>
            <p>We must imagine him only the shape of a man, who makes no serious reflexion on his ways, when the hand of God presseth him sore.</p>
            <p>This was the case of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> for, <hi>when he slew them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ps.</hi> 78.34.</note>
               <hi>then they sought him early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, when God chastens man for sin, will it not make him to bind himself by most solemn vows and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that if he will remove this burthen from his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he will utterly renounce those sins which have made him so miserable, and live hereafter in a stricter observance of his commands.</p>
            <p>What multitudes had infallibly perished, had not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions preserved them from it?</p>
            <p>This is that Shepherds Crook whereby God returns his wandring Sheep to the Fold; Thus the Prodigal Son was brought back again to his Fathers house, he had never thought of the great plenty in his Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, had he not been constrained to feed on Husks.</p>
            <p>Thus the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he was in the belly of the Whale poured forth his prayers unto God.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Susanna</hi> cryed unto the Lord in her distress.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:36814:10"/>
            <p>And thus the Disciples in a Storm implor'd the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of Christ, <hi>Master save us, we perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What School more proper for the instruction of men, then that of affliction? when his Judgments are in the Land, <hi>the Inhabitants of the world shall learn Righteousness;</hi> for those evils he inflicts upon others are warning-pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for all.</p>
            <p>For as the indulgent Mother loves not to behold a mote on the face of her beloved Infant, but will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately wipe the same away; So neither can our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father endure the least blemish of sin on the Souls of his dear Children, but will presently cleanse it with the water of affliction. If thou sin to day, he will afflict to morrow. <hi>For great are, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third Reason why the Lord visits us with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions is to make tryal whether with the Silver-smith we had rather make Shrines for <hi>Diana,</hi> and well paid for our labour, then to erect Temples for the worship of a crucified Jesus, to meet with his Cross for our pains.</p>
            <p>Yes, and thus the goodly fellowship of the Prophets and noble Army of Martyrs were tryed, who were so far from denying the truth, that they did couragiously abide the stroak of death, and choose to loose their lives in tribulation.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Rod</hi> and this <hi>Staff comforted them</hi> with the hopes of their deliverance from the servitude of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into the glorious liberty of the Children of God.</p>
            <p>This was that which comforted these defenders of Christianity, that, whereon they cast their eye in the midst of all the unexpressible tortures the powerful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty malice of the World was able to inflict. With what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36814:11"/> incomparable violence were their Souls separated from their bodies? Nevertheless when mortal members yielded to the Sword of Persecution, then they beheld (though with an eye drenched in bloud and tears) the bright glory which attended them; Yes, and saw (as in a mirrour) the Thorns of those prodigious sufferings disposed into Lawrels and Crowns.</p>
            <p>There the Proto-Martyr St. <hi>Stephen</hi> saw the Stones which pelted him into Heaven, as so many Rubies and pretious Stones to adorn that Crown which was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt his Brows. By this fiery tryal of Persecution, are the Children of God and Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the former will become red with bloud to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve devotion, but the latter will betray it, for they depart from God in the time of Tribulation.</p>
            <p>Many may with that Rock St. <hi>Peter</hi> make solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations to follow Christ and stick close to him, but when they come to <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Hall the faint blasts of a Virgins breath will shake the Rock, and stagger their resolution; But he who follows Christ for the Miracles and not for the Loaves, who courts Religion for her Beauty, and not for her dowry, will not be ashamed to confess his Master, though he is most certainly assured to be mounted on Gibbets and undergo the most rigid Tortures power is able to invent.</p>
            <p>Tribulation is Vertues Furnace, the stouter and more masculine it is, the more it glittereth in affliction.</p>
            <p>This is that rich Diamond which can endure the Wheel, whilst all other things are like Pebbles, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what glittering, but little worth.</p>
            <p>Let any one judge how noble and glorious a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle it is to behold an invincible courage, counterbuffl'd with Storms and Tempests, on whom it seemeth Heaven would burst and fall in peices; Is it not admirable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36814:11"/> him amidst the ruins of the World, and threats of the Air, always standing like to a great Brazen <hi>Colossus,</hi> valuing them at no higher rate then Mists and small Flakes of Snow,? because he is compleatly taught that in the School of Vertue we learn to despise temporal pleasures and to trample on those vanities which others have so much laboured and hunted after.</p>
            <p>Here we are taught mortification and the exercise of those godly and Heroick Actions which give the Soul an antepast of Heaven in this mortal life, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchisement from the fear of death.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>for thou art an offence,</hi> was the rebuke the Son of God gave St. <hi>Peter</hi> when he would have disswaded him from suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the most cruel and ignominious death of the Cross, and then assembling his whole Colledge of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples together, solemnly declared that as they had been the companions of his life, so also must they go share with him in his sorrows, as he, so they likewise must suffer, when the Bridegroom is gone, the Children of the Bridegroom must weep as well as fast.</p>
            <p>For what can be more rude and unhandsome, what can we stile more unbecoming and undecent, than to see the head crowned with Thorns and the Servants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped with softness? To see our Jesus in his Agony, and Good-Friday-apparel, and our selves in our jollity, or <hi>Easter</hi> Robes? To see Christ toyling under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36814:12"/> of the Cross, and we dancing in our Sports? To see him drinking Vinegar and Gall, and we pleasing our foolish appetites? To see Christ of his Cross make a Ladder to ascend his Throne of Glory, and we to stand here with folded arms? To see him travailing through Briars and Thornes, and we unwilling to tread on any thing but Roses?</p>
            <p>Is not this as incongruous as to see Princes walking on their feet, and Servants riding on Horseback? Is not this as great a disunion, as to see the Master in Russet, and the Servant in Purple, faring deliciously every day?</p>
            <p>If therefore we desire to spell out our names amongst his Servants, we must learn Christs Cross over, and not be ashamed of his Livery, the Purple Robe, but must tread the path marked out with that bloud shed for our Redemption.</p>
            <p>For observe that <hi>Dilemma</hi> of Christ, and you'll see there are no thoughts this Cup should pass from us, <hi>He that will save his life,</hi>

            <p>Accept of what part you please, there is a life to be lost, an Hell either here or hereafter, But who is more stupid to the extreamest misery, than he who will rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his grounds for Heaven, to gain a little clay on earth? and who is more wise and fortunate then he, who will lose his life for him? because when Christ shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear attended with Myriads of Angels, the vast Retinue of Coelestial Courtiers, he will confer rewards accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deeds.</p>
            <p>'Tis reported that a Famous Captain should say to a Souldier dying with him, Hadst thou done nothing worthy repute, but remained obscure all thy life time, yet here is honour enough, that to day thou dyest with thy Master.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:36814:12"/>
            <p>What honour and glory then is conferred upon thee, poor dust and ashes! when God picks thee out as the most couragious of his Souldiers to fight in his defence? If he hath reserved pleasures unspeakable for them who barely love him, what Lawrels and Crowns are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them, who love him unto death?</p>
            <p>Where is thy courage therefore O Christian? where is thy spirit? when thou repinest at whatever God lays on thee of this sad nature? <hi>dost thou do well to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry?</hi> Ransack and search into the bottom of thy soul, and see what it is which troubles thy repose.</p>
            <p>'Tis to wean thee from the love of the World, 'tis to make thee reform and lead a new course of life, 'tis to try thy patience and love to him, to see if it be so entire that nothing can draw thy affections from him.</p>
            <p>'Tis out of pure tenderness and kindness to thy soul, that God sends thee afflictions in thy body, crosses in thy state, yes, every sad accident is applyed by that wise Physician of Heaven, to eat out the proud Flesh of our corrupt nature, for he doth not afflict willingly, and grieve the Children of men; He is as it were grieved himself that he is constrained and driven to make use of this medicine, to heal us of our more deadly wounds and putrified sores.</p>
            <p>Is it not an argument of my insensibility, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him who nips and pincheth me, to raise and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken me out of a deep Lethargy? and is it not to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us out of the Lethargy of Sin, that God pincheth us with hardness?</p>
            <p>And what a great influence would it have upon our lives? How would it blunt and dull the edge of evils? what a mighty salve and cure to a mind discomposed by sorrow, seriously to consider, Heaven is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein, but they proceed even from the hand
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36814:13"/> of that God, <hi>who in the midst of Judgment thinks of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and like a mild and compassionate Father, pitieth his child when he is correcting him.</p>
            <p>For if thou knowest this and remain impatient, go to the Beasts, consult Tygers and Lions, who will be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of their Masters and not repine.</p>
            <p>He who extended my Arteries and Veins; he who said unto me <hi>live,</hi> when I was but in the Embryo, still in my bloud;</p>
            <p>'Tis he who made me, that strikes me, he who mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the World, that thinks it convenient to afflict me.</p>
            <p>And what, Shall I fight against my God, and contend with my Maker? shall I dare to struggle with him, who can look me into nothing? yet this, and much more do I when I remain impatient under the heat and Toyl of the day of sorrows.</p>
            <p>To prevent which we must stedfastly resolve to strengthen our courage in bearing our afflictions. First, With an unruffled and quiet mind; we must not in the least murmure, though we pass through the Solitary Wilderness in the saddest and most deserted condition, if it will conduct and lead us to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> we must not be weary of our burthen, but strive to support it with the most serene temper of spirit, least o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, we should dare to charge God foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>But then again in the second place we must also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our thankfulness to God that he hath thought us worthy to suffer for the name of Christ extolling and praising him that he hath made us miserable.</p>
            <p>For as the General places the stoutest men opposite to the hottest services, and sharpest encounters, not that he ows them a spite or bear them a grudge, but to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36814:13"/> the confidence he reposes in their Man-hood and to lead them to triumph.</p>
            <p>Yes, and this is the method of our heavenly Father to pick out the best spirited of his Servants, and the chiefest of his Darlings, that he may crown them with the most noble triumphs, and to conduct them to the greatest honours.</p>
            <p>Let others therefore shrink at the sharp combats of the World, let them cowardly faint under the strong opposition of their adversaries; but as for me, saith the undaunted Christian, the more enemies I encounter, the greater will be my Crown, the harder the labour the more noble my reward; when my enemies encrease I'll call new bloud into my veins; let them overpower me with their multitudes, I will overcome them by my courage; let them come about me like Bees, and encompass me in on every side, yet in the name of my God, I will destroy them.</p>
            <p>Blessed be my God, that I am the man appointed to fight the Lords battels; that he hath begirt me with perils and encircled me with afflictions; I have vowed and am stedfastly purposed to behave my self so coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously that (humanely be it spoken) it shall not repent him of his choice.</p>
            <p>Blessed be my God, that I am ranked amidst the first of Christian Souldiers; that he looks upon me poor and sinful wretch that I am, capable of such glorious atchievements; Iet others then swell with fatness, but O my God, let me be chastened every morning; let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers come in no misfortune, but oh! scourge me and and lash me in this World, that I may not be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that which is to come; let me eat my Garlick and Onyons in this <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that I may feed on the Grapes and Pomegranats in the Land of Promise; let
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36814:14"/> me here feed upon husks, that I may be refreshed with the fatted Calf at the Supper of the Lamb. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you have seen the Righteous in trouble like the <hi>Israelites</hi> in exile, but now the Lord like <hi>Moses</hi> comes to deliver them: hitherto God seemed to sleep, as Christ in the Storm: but now he rebukes the Tempest, and the obedient waves bow themselves, into a Calm, for though, <hi>great are the troubles of the Righteous, yet the Lord will deliver him out of all.</hi>

            <p>God will not leave his Children in endless miseries, they may wander many years in the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> where there is nothing but blackness and darkness, not the least glimmering of joy, yet still he will bring them at length to the Mountains of joy and gladness.</p>

            <p>Upon which account our Holy Mother the Church, hath appointed this day for that solemn purpose, that all devout Christians should meet together to celebrate the Birth of our Redeemer, and to return our praises and thanksgivings to God, for his unspeakable love to Mankind in sending his Eternal Son, to assume our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and to teach, and give examples of holy life, and at last to die for them, rise again, and ascend to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

            <p>For this gift of his only begotten Son, is a mercy of such a weight, that we cannot sufficiently admire and esteem it.</p>

            <p>For our Creation was an act of the Almightys, which proceeded not from any constraint, and tye of necessity, but from the abundant freeness and generosity of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>He should not have needed, unless he had pleased to mould us into Shape, and form us into Creatures.</p>
            <p>What worth or merit can be alledged, miserable dust and ashes that we are? whereby we might claim a prerogative or Title to a Being.</p>
            <p>Alas! it was undeserved; nevertheless he did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force or compulsion, which was an Illustrious Act of his free grace and bounty, yet farr excelled by that much more eminent one, in the Redemption of us from the slavery and servitude of sin and Satan, yes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instating of us in a better condition, then that which our First Parents so justly forfeited.</p>
            <p>To love us before we were, I confess is great love; but to love us when we had rendred our selves vile, yea, and worse then nothing, what can it be stiled, but the heighth of love?</p>

            <p>For had not the Father sent him on that errand, how had we been broken in peices, like a Potters Vessel; Whips, Scourges and Scorpions, had been our portion,

               <hi>and is risen again for their Justification,</hi> that is, as verily as all men have sinned by contraction of the guilt of the first man, so by the merits of the Man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, they are justified freely by Gods grace, if they do not fall off from the mercy of the Covenant, by prevaricating the conditions of it.</p>
            <p>For through his bloud he hath conveyed notice to all men, that they are the Sons of God, that they are the Heirs of eternity, Coheirs with Christ, and partakers of the Divine Nature, meaning, that they are so by the design of God, and the purpose of the manifestation of his Son, he being unwilling any should perish, but that all should be saved.</p>
            <p>Such was the unmeasurable love of Christ that he would have all men to be saved, without exception of City or Country, Nation or Language, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ungodly, enemies, nay, without exception of them that perish, for it is to give them a space to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</note>
               <hi>that he is stack (as some men count slackness) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his promise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! in our late years of Rebellion when men pretending to fight the Battels of the Lord, took up the Weapons of the Divel, and under a pretext of the Lords cause entered a solemn league and covenant and swore Allegiance to the Prince of Darkness, then also began to flourish their doctrine who say, that God designed many Souls to Hell before they had a Being and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence upon earth, insomuch they were incapacitated
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36814:27"/> to work out their salvation, their sentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being already past in the predeterminate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of God, then began men to flatter themselves that they were the only Children of God, the Saints that should inherit the earth; and none but they the true people of <hi>Sion,</hi> who were the espousers of their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical opinion and perswasion, judging all others to be held as Reprobates in the eyes of God because they were so in theirs.</p>
            <p>Then was broached that opinion of a converting grace and irresistable power, as if God would urge men to salvation, and make them happy without any endeavours of their own, if they did but rely on Christ and his Merits for the payment and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Which Doctrines are of so pernicious consequence, that, First it renders the Cross of Christ foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>For wherefore did God give us his Son? wherefore did he die, rise again, and ascend to his Father? to what purpose was all that wast of bloud which he shed in our behalf? if men were absolutely decreed to salvation or reprobation from all eternity? to what end did Christ come into the world, when as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consideration to his sufferings or the merits of his death and passion his Father had predetermined from eternity such a number for the pleasures of Heaven, and so many for torment without end?</p>
            <p>If it be thus, then is Christ dead in vain, because the Father might have effected this without putting his Son to the expences of his bloud to redeem us. If it be thus the Father had no great love for his Son, to put him to such cruelties and hardships, not having any cogent or absolute necessity. Nay, if this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36814:27"/> was true, it would blemish the wisdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for if he had resolved to save some and damn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from eternity, he might have done it without the contrivance of that device of reconciling us to himself by the death of his Son, because that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to satisfie his Justice and manifest his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and what need of that if we consent to a predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</p>
            <p>But then Secondly, As it renders the death of Christ insignificant, unnecessary, so if this be true, then is our preaching vain.</p>
            <p>For to what end serve all the commands, instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, calls, counsels, admonitions and reproofs of the Gospel? for first, they are unnecessary to those who are elected, since if they be fully perswaded that they are decreed to salvation from eternity, what need they trouble themselves about it, when they know they shall be brought in (in Gods due time and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) by such a converting grace and power as cannot be resisted by them.</p>
            <p>And as the Gospel is useless to these, so in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place to those who are reprobate, for if they be fully perswaded thereof, to wit, that they must inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably perish, do they what is possible to prevent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, why should men beat the air, in labouring to perswade them to that which both the persons to be taught, and the persons teaching, are fully persuaded can never be effected by them.</p>
            <p>Nay further, let us suppose a man doubtful of his state, yet if he consent to this doctrine, is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion as if he should say, if I be of that number God hath determined from eternity to save, I shall be saved, though I do what seemeth good in my own eyes, for at some time or other, which I am as yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36814:28"/> off, he will force me from my sins, and compel me to obedience by such a power as cannot be resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me; but if it be my hard lot to be put in the Catalogue of reprobates, let me be never so industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to work out my salvation, let me wear the ground with my religious knees by my constancy in praying; let me pine my body to a Skelleton by the austerities of fasting and humbling my self before God; let me be never so religious never so devout, yet still I must be fuel for that fire prepar'd for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, because it was decreed so from eternity, and is more unalterable than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the fruit which springs from so corrupt a root, and the very case of <hi>Ludovicus,</hi> that learned <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> for he was so miserably infected with this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that no arguments and reasonings could convince him of its error, till perceiving himself indisposed, and already fallen into the Neighborhoods of sickness he sends for the Physician, who (made acquainted with his opinion) answered him in his own stile, <hi>if he should live, he should live, without trying the experiments of his art and skill,</hi> the Patient ruminating on his words at last was convinced in his Conscience, that as means were to be applied for the restauration of health, so likewise for the salvation of the soul.</p>
            <p>Away then with this deluding phantasie, which is the parent of nothing but those Twin-Sisters of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, presumption and despair; and let us endeavour to justifie God in his saying that his will is, that all should be saved;<note place="margin">

               <hi>he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that any one should perish,</hi> and so again God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath sworn, <hi>that he delighteth not in the death of a sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps some may contest that if it be the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and will of God, that all should be saved, how comes it to pass so many fall short and miss of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (designed by God) glory everlasting?</p>
            <p>I answer,</p>
            <p>The Holy Scriptures have recorded Gods will to be two-fold, his Absolute, and his Conditional Will.</p>
            <p>The former God used when he framed the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Structure of the World, and said, <hi>let there be light, and there was light; let there be a Firmament and there was a Firmament?</hi> So likewise, when he created those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal intelligencers, the Angels, he spake the Word and they were made; he commanded and they were created. This is the absolute and only irresistable Will of God.</p>
            <p>But in matters relating to the Salvation of Men, he made use of the Second, his Conditional Will.</p>
            <p>And those Conditions were three.</p>
            <p>The First was in Paradise, <hi>eat not, and thou shalt live;</hi> but how soon did we forfeit this Covenant by an han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering and prurient desire after the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:36814:29"/>
            <p>The Second was under the Law, <hi>do this and thou shalt live.</hi> And here though the spirit was never so willing, yet so many were the weaknesses and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the flesh, that we groaned under its weight and were not able to perform it, until Christ the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filler of the Law came to ease us of its burthen; and then he made a third and new agreement with us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, and that is, <hi>believe on the Son of God, and thou shalt be saved.</hi> To the performance of which he hath afforded such powerful aids, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that we may observe the tenour of his Laws, and live for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we will not observe his Laws, but break our bonds asunder, we justly forfeit our right in Christ, and may charge God foolishly, but thank our selves for damnation.</p>
            <p>For though our Creation was the work of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency alone, yet the salvation of our souls can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be effected without our endeavours.</p>
            <p>He hath opened a fountain for us to bath in, but if we refuse to wash and be clean, who is to blame for the continuance of our Leprosie?</p>
            <p>Nay further, he doth not only to our Justification add the invitations of his grace and holy Spirit to dispose our selves for it, promising to ease and refresh such as are <hi>weary and heavy laden with the burthen of their sins,</hi> but positively declares he stands at the door of our hearts, knocks and solicites to enter, but if we will not suffer the King of glory to come in, may not he justly defie the World to object the least fault and blame on his side, since he hath done to his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard whatever could be thought requisite to make it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36814:29"/> thrive and prosper? and if they finally perish, (as I shall shew more at large by and by) are they not the authors of their own perdition by their rejecting those abundantly sufficient graces he hath offered them to accept? So that in the extremity of their misery they will be forced to confess, <hi>thou art Righteous O Lord, and thy judgments are just.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some further object, that though the satisfaction Christ made was sufficient for the whole World, yet (say they) it was not effectual, that is, (I conceive) he did not intend all should participate of the benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>And what is this, but (by the worst kind of enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) to circumscribe his All-sufficient goodness? to set banks and shores to that unlimited Ocean of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which cannot consist with the wisdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ; for if he paid a full and plenary satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the offences of all men, was it not as easie and more agreeable to his mercy to communicate the benefits to all, than to appropriate them only to a few and little parcel of men?</p>
            <p>Any in the shape of a man would censure it a meer delusion, for the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> to proclaim himself Redeemer of all the captivated Christians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyrany of <hi>Ziim</hi> and <hi>Ochim, Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> if he should send over Ransom large enough for all, yet afterwards cashiere the poor Captives hopes of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by interpreting himself, though I proclaimed and sent sufficiently for all, yet I meant Redemption only to a few.</p>
            <p>Would not this renew our griefs and augment our sorrows? and if it was so with God, what anxieties and fears, what troubles and scruples would it move in our minds, whether we were the persons whom
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36814:30"/> the King delighted to honour? for if we conceited we were the Children elected by God,, and God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from eternity to save us, what licence would it give to our unbridled desires by presuming too much on the Patience and long-suffering of God, when we believe we cannot be dis-inherited from being Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with the Son of God, and so make us neglect the working out our salvation, knowing that our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is in vain, because before we were, God had determined we should not miss of our Diadem of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>But blessed be God, no mans state is fixed, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, before he hath a Being, much less from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or before the foundations of the earth were laid, nay, now we have a being, it is possible to pass from the state of death to the life of grace</p>
            <p>'Tis true when we are cut off from the Land of the living, and are arrived at our long home, then our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and the decree of God is unchangeable, for <hi>where the Tree falleth there it lyeth.</hi>

            <p>Let this consideration rouze us from the Lethargy of sin, that we may work whilst the day of salvation lasteth, before <hi>the night cometh, when no man can work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we do, let us do quickly, for though the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may seem to swell in our bones, our bloud hot and boyl in our veins, though we pride our selves in the strength and flower of nature, yet still, is not our time in the hand of God? <hi>who can tell what a day may bring forth?</hi>

            <p>We begin with the Action.</p>
            <p>And first, He gave it <hi>gratis,</hi> freely, and of his own accord; for he was omnipotent and could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by any force, all Creatures depending on him alone,<note place="margin">

            <p>He was delivered up to the malice and fury of evil men, and thence delivered up to the ignominious death of the Cross.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Nay God did not only deliver him up, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sent him, <hi>For,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>in this was manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Love of God, because he sent his only begotten Son into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly.

            <p>It was the Worlds Price was set to sale, and how dearly did he purchase it? What reason then have we to spend every moment of our Life in loving, praising, and glorifying him? And when we contemplate these

            <p>O God what shall we return thee in requital, or wherewith shall we appear before thee? When we would praise thee, an Abysse of Majesty exhausts in a moment all Encomiums, and our adorations what are they before thy Divine Essence? Could we render our selves uncreated in deference to thee the Fountain of all Beings, it were a poor Homage to thy ineffable Greatness: Nay could we annihilate the World, and bring all Creatures into their old postures of nothing for thy Glory, yet what is this compar'd with what thy immensity might justly expect? But while we labour with our Poverty, finding nothing created worthy thy acceptance (Oh astonishing Mercy!) behold the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect oblation of thy Son, which thou hast given us, the prodigious Effect of thy <hi>Love.</hi> Him we offer unto thee, and through him we hope to be accepted: None can speak our Gratitude, but that word, who can only sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thy Justice: Since by this Gift the very Treasury of Heaven was emptied for a time, and the Earth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with that pure Sacrifice wherewith thou wert well pleased; and the Odour thereof draws upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind a continual Floud of Mercies. This is a Sacrifice O God, thou wilt not despise; him we offer unto thee, and with him our selves and all that we have, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to accept of us for the sake of thy Son, who was offered up for us all.</p>

            <p>This is that great Mistery the Apostle speaks of, God manifested in the Flesh;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> where we may behold the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Father giving up his only Son in behalf of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind polluted and depraved by corruption, vitiated by sin, disobedient to his Lord, and insolent to his King; a Worm, and no Man, a poor scantling of putrifaction, and a prey for the never-dying Worm to feed upon. How well therefore is it stiled a Mistery, that a God most perfect in himself, who stood in no need or want, should love so forlorn a Creature (by reason of his sin) at such vast and great distances from him, who could do him small service and stand him in little stead.</p>
            <p>Yet still this immense Being, hath, out of his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Bounty, given us the dear production of himself, coeternal, consubstantial, and equal, to the Father in respect of his God-head, though inferiour to the Father as touching his Man-hood; God and Man, a Problem, whose solution puzzleth all the Reason humanity pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth a Riddle which cannot be unfolded but by Faith.</p>
            <p>Did we not behold it through that Perspective, but employ our reason to consider it, we should as soon conclude to the Suns Union with a Clod, or a Thoughts Corporeity, as to believe immortality incarnate, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality turn'd body, and the infinite Ocean of goodness in so small a Vessel.</p>
            <p>The composure of the World, and the variety of Creatures, was the effect of an Almighty Power, that Man should be made after the Image of God; wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough, but that God should be made like Man, is much more admirable.</p>
            <p>'Twas a greater demonstration of his Omnipotency, that God should be made a like Creature, than his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36814:33"/> of all Creatures. Immortality put on Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Incorruption dressed in the garments of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>We read that the Ark of the Covenant was overlaid with Gold, whilst Shittim wood was in the midst, which was to Typifie Christs Humanity decked and adorned with his God-head.</p>
            <p>A Mystery so fruitful in Miracles, that natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son cannot comprehend them. Nature was stopt as to the result of an humane subsistence, in whose place was intimately applyed the Personality of the Divine Word, and this infinite subsistence was adorned with graces, virtues, and privileges superiment.</p>
            <p>Dost thou wonder to see the Sea divided and stand upon an heap; come here then and admire this bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Ocean contained in the narrow Vessel of a Virgins Body? Dost thou wonder to see the Bush in the midst of hungry Fire and not consumed, behold a Virgin, the Mother of a Son, and yet her Virginity spotless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled? Dost thou wonder to see a <hi>Moses</hi> preserved in a Cradle of Bull-rushes, behold the King of Heaven in a Manger? Was it strange to see the Sun go back on the Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> how marvellous then is it, to fee the true Sun, Light of very Light, under a small cloud, and the most glorious Candle of Heaven put under a Bushel? Dost thou wonder the Bread of Life became Flesh, look into the Sacrament of his Supper, and see how he can turn his Body and Bloud into Bread and Wine to nourish the Souls of Men? Dost thou wonder at the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> lo a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> is here. How did the Wisdom of God become foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for us, and the Word it self speechless? <hi>And He who is our God, is He not also our Brother?</hi> Rouze up thy self then, O my dull and sordid soul, mount up thy self
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36814:33"/> even to the Heavens above, slighting the things of the World, as dross and dung, if compar'd with the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Title of being the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Many an express had been sent unto us from the Court of Heaven by those winged Embassadours, the Angels, But, Oh infinite mercy! He now sends his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Ã  latere,</hi> his Son from his bosom, expecting he would be more honourably treated by us: But alas! how did we entertain him? 'Tis true he had his brows encircled with a Crown, but it was of Thorns.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, he was a King, but annointed with his own bloud; or as the Evangelical Prophet stiles him, <hi>a King of sorrows:</hi> 'Tis true, he had a Purple Robe, but it was of derision.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, he had a Bed-chamber, but it was a Stable; 'tis true, he had a Cradle, but it was a Manger to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the saying which was written, <hi>The Oxe lodged with his own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>r, and the Ass and the Master were content with the same Crib.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was he an <hi>Isaac,</hi> a Son of Laughter, or rather, <hi>vir dolorum,</hi> a man of griefs? Was he clothed in his dress of Majesty? or did he disguise himself in Purples and Furrs, that he might enjoy ease and govern all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth? or rather, was he not clothed with shame and dishonour? Did not Heav'n, nay the God of Heav'n descend to Earth, that Earth might ascend to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thy Fore-head was furrowed with Thorns, O blessed Jesu, yet thou wouldst not frown: We did chain those Arms, which thou didst stretch forth to embrace thy Enemies, and those who continually provoke thee to wrath; thy Bowels of tender compassion yearned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, who were ready to rake into thine with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36814:34"/> their bloudy hands; Oh! most compassionate Son of the most merciful Father!</p>
            <p>What shall we render unto thee for all thy mercies? How shall we pay our acknowledgements? whom shall we love? to whom shall we resign our Wills and ways, but unto thee, and the Father of mercies who hath not thought the gift of his Son too great to confer upon us? Oh blessed Incarnation! oh happy day! never will we forget thee, but entirely devote our selves to his service and worship, who hath this day called us to be his Son by adoption, settle our affections and confirm us in this our resolution, that by the influence of thy Holy Spirit we may obtain the end and purpose of thy Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, everlasting.</p>
            <p>Which is the last to be considered.</p>
            <p>And the words are easie to be understood, for by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> is meant whosoever shall receive and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the doctrine of his Gospel, and frame his life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules thereof, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> shall not perish but be rescued from eternal death, and made partaker of eternal life, but on the contrary, if we disown him, and reject his rules, we shall receive no benefits by the merits of his death and Passion, for though Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven should become a desart, yet he will not people it with persons refractory and disobedient, but the sentence of the first Curse shall not be repealed, but still hold valid and of force; for if they will work their own destruction by refusing to lay hold on Chtist, this inconveniency happens unto them, not from the inefficacy of Christs satisfaction, or a defect of his commiseration, and goodness towards his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.</note> but from their own default, because as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks <hi>they deny him by whom they were bought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He purchased the souls of the whole World, but if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36814:34"/> they will not accept of such a Ransom by believing on him, and regulating their wills, by his will, they may be damned though he was offered up a Sacrifice for them; thus the Apostle tells us,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11.</note>
               <hi>thy Brother perish for whom Christ died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For he died for all, yet those only receive the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereof, who believe on him by their obedienee to his word.</p>
            <p>For though the Sun was placed in the Firmament of Heaven, that the whole World might be cherished by the influence of its heat and light, yet how many are there to whom it is not much beneficial; for are there not some of so reserv'd and melancholy a disposition, that they are more affected with darkness, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they creep into Grots and Holes to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the glory of his Beams.</p>
            <p>In like manner, light came into the World, and was offer'd up for the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, Catholick good of all, but some loving darkness rather then light, keep themselves baricadoed from his benign influence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the light of faith, for otherwise he should not perish, but have everlasting life,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.</note> which is best inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by that curt, yet full expression of St. <hi>Paul, he is the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kingdom of Heaven is shut up against none, though some are so unhappy as to exclude themselves, for they are so far degenerated into Brutes, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dreadful apprehensions of an angry God, <hi>a consuming fire,</hi> or <hi>Worm that never dyes</hi> can frighten them into obedience, or can the invitatory Charms of Holy things allure them thereunto, or lastly, can the modest shame of a base and ignoble action move them; for like ill-distempered bodies they convert all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36814:35"/> wholsome food into their own corrupted humours, saying unto God <hi>depart from us, we desire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his ways: who is the Almighty that we should serve him? or what benefit accrues to us, if we pray to him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, they abhor <hi>the knowledge of his ways and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> because they are contrary and speak against their works.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They refuse submission to his power, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading themselves he is not <hi>Almighty,</hi> because sentence is not executed speedily, but he is <hi>Merciful, Long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Gracious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then lastly, They will not <hi>pray unto him,</hi> because they would ask that which is so repugnant to his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme wisdom and goodness, that they know he will not answer their petitions.</p>
            <p>So that in short, it is through themselves they perish and come not to bliss and glory, because they decline the presence of God, shutting up all the avenues of faith and charity, through which he should come in unto them.</p>
            <p>For God hath engaged his word not to be inexorable, and the Creator hath protested and sworn that it is far from his thoughts to delight himself in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Creature.</p>
            <p>For can the charity of a grave and sober person upon earth pray for the conversion and salvation of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and what? shall the charity of Christ be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or will they ravish him of his goodness? No, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, he would have none to perish, but upon their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, he will embrace them with the arms of his mercy, receive them for his own Children by Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, give them the blessings of eternal life, and make them partakers of his everlasting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Seeing then this was the end and drift of Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36814:35"/> seeing God hath dealt thus graciously with us, <hi>what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and godliness?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ought we to esteem and love him, who so esteemed and loved us, that he thought not his life and bloud too dear for us?</p>
            <p>How ought we to esteem our selves, since God hath thought us worthy to be esteemed of him? Let us remember, this and know that we are men.</p>
            <p>How ought we to take heed that we neither spot or soil that flesh wherein God hath manifested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>For what are we the better that God hath given us his Son, if there be not a mystical Incarnation in our hearts, and his Nativity our spiritual Birth-day, that being born anew, Christ may dwell in us and we in him.</p>
            <p>Was it not his purpose to be like us, that we might be like him? was he not born of a poor Virgin, to teach us to be meek and lowly? did he not take upon him the form of a Servant, to teach us we must not Lord it over them who are beneath us?</p>
            <p>How little did he value the pomp and grandeur of the World, to set our affections on things above? how contented was he in a mean condition, to teach us not to take care for to Morrow? How courteous was he to the meanest Clients, to teach us humanity and brotherly kindness? how liberal was he of doing good, to teach us to be diligent in relieving the neeessity of the Indigent? How patient was he in suffering the the mockeries and scoffs of the ruder multitude, to teach us not to pay evil for evil? how patient was he amidst the sad tortures and pangs of the Cross, to teach us not to repine at the chastisements and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36814:36"/> of Heaven? How little did he fancy the applauses of men, to teach us not to court popularity, or be fond of the praises of men? How absolutely did he resign up his Will to the Will of his Father, to teach us in every state to say, <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven?</hi> In a word, how did he lay down his Life in full hopes of a glorious Resurrection; to teach us to say: <hi>Though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Skin worms destroy my Body, yet in my Flesh shall I see God whom I my self shall behold, and not another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the Beauties of Jesus to be equally admir'd and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by us: This is a Transcript of the Deity, which we must carry always in our hearts; for by the copying of it, Christ knows who are his.</p>
            <p>Let us then endeavour to follow our Exemplar as close as we can in these steps of his Holy Life: Let us not slight that Love which is gone to prepare us a place in his Fathers House: Let us make all things conspire to proclaim his Glory: Let us conceive Christ in our heart by our believing and hearing his word; and let us bring him forth in our life by giving all diligence to practice and perform it.</p>
            <p>Let us look on the Mercy of this day as an hopeful assurance, that God will never end his Love and good Will towards Men, till he hath brought us thither, where Jesus is.</p>
            <p>Let us earnestly beseech him to guide us in those steps, whereby he did ascend from Earth to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Let us desire him so earnestly to subdue our Wills to His, that it may be our Meat and Drink to perform his Heavenly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Which, that it may be more effectually wrought for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interest of us all; let us fall down and say in sincerity of heart:</p>
